Computer randomly chooses two numbers which are 'a' and 'b', and also the two numbers shouldn't be a same number.
The computer always compare the two numbers to check a difference between 'a' and 'b' using subtraction.
The computer always calculates to check the difference between 'a' and 'b' using "'a'-'b'='c'".
If 'c' is less than '0', 'b' is bigger than 'a'.
