/*********************************************************************
Write a loan calculator program. The user borrows A dollars at R%interest (compounded monthly) and makes a payment of P dollars at theend of each month. Your program should get all of this informationfrom the user as well as Y, a number of years to simulate, and shouldreturn the balance left after Y years. A typical run of the programmight look something like this: Enter the amount borrowed: 10000Enter the monthly payment you'll make: 200Enter the annual interest rate: 7.5Enter the number of years you want to simulate: 3At the end of 3 years you owe 4468.19 dollars By running the program several times, you should be able to tell meapproximately how long it'll take to pay off your debt. For those that are unfamiliar with annual rates compounded monthly, ifR is the given annual rate and we do monthly compounding, then eachmonth's interest is computed at the rate R/12. Remember, if yourbalance owed at the beginning of the month is b then your balance owedat the end of the month will b(1 + (R/100)/12) minus the payment P youmake at the end of the month. ***********************************************************************/
